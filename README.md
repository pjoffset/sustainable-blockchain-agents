# Sustainable Blockchain Agents

## Overview

The **Sustainable Blockchain Agents** project aims to develop AI agents that ensure blockchain technologies operate energy-efficiently. As blockchain networks grow, so does their energy consumption, which poses significant environmental challenges. This project focuses on analyzing energy usage patterns in blockchain transactions and providing actionable recommendations to optimize energy consumption while maintaining performance.

## Project Goals

- **Energy Efficiency**: Reduce the overall energy consumption of blockchain operations.
- **AI Integration**: Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze transaction data and predict energy needs.
- **Smart Contracts**: Implement smart contracts that enforce energy-efficient practices within the blockchain ecosystem.
- **Scalability**: Design a system that can scale with increasing transaction volumes while maintaining efficiency.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (or any compatible blockchain for smart contracts)
- **Programming Languages**: 
  - Python for AI and backend logic
  - Solidity for smart contracts
- **Data Storage**: JSON files for transaction data
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 
  - NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
  - Scikit-learn for any potential machine learning models (if needed)


## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd sustainable-blockchain-agents

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. (Optional) If you want to deploy the smart contract, ensure you have a development environment set up (like Ganache) and install Truffle or Hardhat.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a JSON file named `transactions.json` in the `data/` directory with transaction data structured as follows:
 ```
 [
     {"id": 1, "energy_consumed": 120},
     {"id": 2, "energy_consumed": 80},
     {"id": 3, "energy_consumed": 50},
     {"id": 4, "energy_consumed": 30}
 ]
 ```

2. Run the main script:
python main.py

3. Deploy the smart contract using a tool like Remix or Hardhat to a test Ethereum network (e.g., Ganache):
- Open Remix IDE.
- Load `EnergyEfficient.sol`.
- Compile and deploy it on your local Ethereum network.

4. Interact with the smart contract through web3.js or ethers.js in your frontend application or via scripts.

## Features

- **Energy Analysis**: The AI agent analyzes transaction data and calculates average energy consumption.
- **Recommendations**: Provides actionable recommendations based on energy usage patterns.
- **Transaction Optimization**: Filters out high-energy-consuming transactions based on predefined criteria.
- **Smart Contract Enforcement**: Ensures that only transactions meeting energy efficiency standards are processed.

## Example Workflow

1. **Data Input**: Populate `transactions.json` with real or simulated transaction data.
2. **Run Analysis**: Execute `main.py` to analyze energy consumption.
3. **Receive Recommendations**: The AI agent outputs recommendations based on current energy usage.
4. **Optimize Transactions**: Apply optimizations suggested by the AI agent before submitting transactions to the blockchain.
